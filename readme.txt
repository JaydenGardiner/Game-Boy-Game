I Shed the Blood of the Saxon Men
by Jayden Gardiner

You are Charlemagne fighting in the Bloody Verdict of Verden (October 782 AD).

Your mission: Shed the blood of 4000 Saxon men.

They wouldn't renounce their heathen ways.

Oh and beware the exploding walls and stuff.

Controls on an emulator:

Note: The concept is a reference to the comedic song "The Bloody Verdict of Verden" by rock god Christopher Lee.
